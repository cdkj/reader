# reader

Reading novels on the web is undoubtedly a comfortable way of leisure, but sometimes I'm embarrassed to be found.

In order not to let the boss, teacher or beautiful girls next to your seat find that you are reading a novel online, this "reader" uses terminal as the reader. 

When you adjust the transparency, the interface for reading novels will become very cool. You can even use the built-in shortcut key in the reader to switch the work and novel reading interface.
